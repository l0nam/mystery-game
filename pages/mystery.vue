        <span class="name">Dr. Carter:</span> The energy spikes near the Spawn
        area are unlike anything we've seen before. They're… unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Reynolds:</span> Unstable? That's putting it
        lightly. These readings suggest an anomaly. Something beyond our
        understanding is resonating.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Carter:</span> I ran the numbers. There's a focal
        point — a single object causing this turbulence. If we don't act, the
        fabric of this world may begin to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Reynolds:</span> And you think “it” could
        stabilize the waves?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Carter:</span> It's the only way. The artifact's
        unique properties could balance the energies. But acquiring it is…
        complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Reynolds:</span> You mean the object resting high
        atop the obsidian pillars in that forsaken dimension?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Carter:</span> Precisely. It's rare,
        irreplaceable, and vital to the world's survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Reynolds:</span> Then we have no choice. We must
        secure it before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Carter:</span> We won't be able to do this alone.
        But we have two allies who might help.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Reynolds:</span> You mean the President? I doubt
        he'll intervene unless he sees the direct consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Carter:</span> Perhaps. But there's another… a
        specialist in hiding things where no one would think to look. They call
        him Steghide.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Reynolds:</span> Steghide? That's an old name. If
        he's still around, he may know how to uncover hidden traces of the
        artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="name">Dr. Carter:</span> We have no other options. We need
        to find them — before the anomaly grows too strong.
      </p>
