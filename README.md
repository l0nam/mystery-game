# The Lost Archive 🕵️‍♂️  

Welcome to **The Lost Archive** – an experimental interactive project exploring the boundaries of digital traces and hidden data.  
This repository contains small web components that allow you to explore the basics of web development, encryption, and network security.

## 📌 About the Project  
**The Lost Archive** is a collection of web pages and encrypted data that might hide more than it seems at first glance.  
Some elements were added for educational purposes, others for entertainment. We provide no instructions, but who knows—perhaps this repository has already become part of something bigger.

## 🔑 Features  
- A minimalist design inspired by retro computer systems.  
- Basic data verification mechanisms (such as password input).  
- Exploration of various ways to store information in files.  
- Possibility to expand functionality through external tools.

## 🔍 How to Use?  
This project does not require installation. You can open the HTML pages directly in your browser.  
Some features may seem useless at first glance, but sometimes, it's not the program itself that matters, but its context.

## 🚀 Additional Notes  
This project was conceived as a conceptual experiment. Some aspects have been intentionally hidden, while others remain unfinished.  
The code is free to study and modify, but remember: **some things are not meant for everyone**.
